The therapist’s job is to be a guide in this\\nexploration, and this function can be divided into four broad areas: 1) feeding\\nback the verbal and nonverbal experience and behavior of the patient —\\nparticularly those areas that the person is less aware, or unaware, of — to\\nintensify and clarify the ongoing process, 2) suggesting experiential here-and-\\nnow experiments for the person to try out as a means to self-discovery, 3)\\nexpressing his own awareness of his responding to the patient (in this, the\\ntherapist is providing information about the person’s impact, as well as\\nproviding a model for the open communication of experiencing), and 4)\\nacting as teacher by providing principles and strategies that are useful guides\\nto deepening awareness. Thus, Gestalt is also experiential, behavioral,\\nexperimental, and educational.\\nGestalt makes a crucial and fundamental distinction between perceptual\\nreality and mental fantasy.

Other early\\ninfluences were Perls’s work with gestalt psychologists, his experiences in\\ntheater and psychodrama, and the thinking of Wilheim Reich. Later Perls\\nmade considerable use of ideas from Zen Buddhism, Taoism, Existential\\nPhenomenology, and general semantics. A second book, Gestalt Therapy,\\ncoauthored by Goodman and Hefferline, was published in 1951. Perls\\ncontinued to develop and modify his work by invention, and by adapting\\ntechniques — such as the “empty chair” and group format — from other\\ntherapies until his death in early 1970. Gestalt Therapy gained widespread\\nrecognition only in the late 1960s, and it was during this time that Perls\\nproduced two more books, and a great number of films and audiotapes\\ndemonstrating his work.\\nwww.freepsychotherapybooks.org\\n8'),\n",

It takes as the heart of the\\nclinical problem the patient\\'s reluctance to change—that ubiquitous and\\nparadoxical phenomenon of our work in which people come to us asking for help\\nin changing, and then do their level best to keep change from happening. Freud\\nnoticed this problem from the beginning, and located the necessity to confront\\nresistance as the central problem of technique. Soon he joined that discovery with\\nthat of the transference, making the work with transference and resistance the\\nhallmark of psychoanalytic technique.\\nMuch of classical psychoanalytic and psychotherapeutic training in North\\nAmerica has followed Freud in placing work with resistance at the center of\\ntechnique. The dictum \\'\\'First interpret the resistance, and only then the impulse,\"\\nhas characterized the mainstream of training in this country for many years, in\\ncontrast to the technical suppositions of the British schools of Klein and object\\nrelations, which emphasized the use of the transference, often encouraging early\\ninterpretation of the transference equally on the side of the resistance born out of\\nfear and the wish born out of neediness. The Kleinians particularly emphasized the\\nimportance of understanding the patient\\'s aggressive and libidinal approach to the\\ntherapist from the beginning of the process, teaching that early interpretation of'),\n",

His emphasis on the need for\\ntherapist empathy for the patient seemed to shift emphasis away from the analysis\\nof resistance, and toward the repair of deficit in the patient’s experience, toward\\nthe patient’s need for the therapist to be a compliant “self object,” serving the\\npatient rather than confronting, subserving need rather than understanding conflict.\\nThese two developments combine to make a reexamination of the central\\nconcepts and tenets of ego psychology a crucial undertaking. Ego psychology is\\nstill the central orientation in American psychoanalysis and analytic psychotherapy,\\nalthough the influence from these other schools is increasingly manifest. We can no\\nlonger accept the old tenets of theory or practice without question, for they are\\nbeing questioned by both friendly and unfriendly critics. Does this mean they have\\nlittle or no meaning? Or can we undertake the task of reexamination and refinement\\nto improve and clarify the essential contribution that the old conveyed?\\nIt is obvious from my question that I believe we should and can do this work,\\nbut as important as it is, it is difficult. It requires that those who would undertake\\nsuch a task steep themselves in the new contributions without abandoning the old,\\nlook for the similarities and differences with a critical but open mind, and do the\\npainful work of synthesizing from a position of flexibility and openness rather than\"),\n",

In her longer\\nvolume on resistance, she has examined the theoretical underpinnings of these\\nprocesses, but in this volume she has done something even more unusual: she has\\ndefined specifically the refinements to technique that follow from her theoretical\\nexamination. \"Here,\" she says, \"one can usefully say this, and there, we can suggest\\nanother approach.\" This specificity is not only useful to the novice therapist. It\\nenables the experienced practitioner and teacher to follow her argument down to\\nits practical consequence, to see clearly the implication of her argument, and to\\nagree or disagree with an equal specificity—that is, to engage in a thoughtful\\ncounterpoint.\\nAlong the way to this achievement, Dr. Stark has examined and synthesized a\\ngreat deal. While her background and training are centered in ego psychology, she\\nhas studied and absorbed the teachings of Kohut and Klein; of Winnicott and\\nFairbairn. She brings the lessons of these theorists and contributors to bear as she\\nenlarges the notion of working with resistance to formulate a compleat approach to\\npsychotherapy, one consistent with classical psychoanalytic psychotherapy, but\\nenriched and enlarged by the wisdom she has acquired in her broader travels. What\\nemerges is a work that is a specific guide, but one that does not suffer from\\noversimplification or narrow-mindedness. This is a work which is at once a\\npractical guide and a theoretical tour de force.

The id needs are physiological and the ego needs are\\nmore psychological.\\nIf an id need is frustrated, the patient experiences rage. The rage experienced by\\nthe patient in the here and now belongs in part to the current frustrating situation but\\nin larger part to the original traumatic failure situation.

Therefore, it should not be all that difficult for the therapist to\\nfacilitate resolution of the negative transference.\\nIn a situation of inverted transference, however, the patient maintains the power,\\nthrough his identification with the powerful parent and his assignment of\\npowerlessness to the therapist (who will be hard-pressed not to accept such an\\nassignment). In effect, the locus of control is invested in the patient, which robs the\\ntherapist of his therapeutic effectiveness and makes it much harder for the therapist\\nto facilitate resolution of the negative transference. In other words, with a direct\\ntransference, the therapist retains his power. But with an inverted transference, the\\npatient wrests the therapist's power from him and weakens him.\"),\n",

The therapist’s job is to be a guide in this\\nexploration, and this function can be divided into four broad areas: 1) feeding\\nback the verbal and nonverbal experience and behavior of the patient —\\nparticularly those areas that the person is less aware, or unaware, of — to\\nintensify and clarify the ongoing process, 2) suggesting experiential here-and-\\nnow experiments for the person to try out as a means to self-discovery, 3)\\nexpressing his own awareness of his responding to the patient (in this, the\\ntherapist is providing information about the person’s impact, as well as\\nproviding a model for the open communication of experiencing), and 4)\\nacting as teacher by providing principles and strategies that are useful guides\\nto deepening awareness. Thus, Gestalt is also experiential, behavioral,\\nexperimental, and educational.\\nGestalt makes a crucial and fundamental distinction between perceptual\\nreality and mental fantasy.

Other early\\ninfluences were Perls’s work with gestalt psychologists, his experiences in\\ntheater and psychodrama, and the thinking of Wilheim Reich. Later Perls\\nmade considerable use of ideas from Zen Buddhism, Taoism, Existential\\nPhenomenology, and general semantics. A second book, Gestalt Therapy,\\ncoauthored by Goodman and Hefferline, was published in 1951.

My concerned girlfriend asked me \\nwhat I was doing for it, to which I replied, “I’m reading Marcus \\nAurelius.” I don’t remember whether or not the philosophical Roman \\nEmperor raised my spirits, but he certainly didn’t cure my upper \\nrespiratory misery. The Stoics’ message was basically that nothing is \\ngood or bad in itself; thinking makes it so. Ipso facto, change your \\nthought pattern and whatever was depressing you will lose its power. The \\nStoics deduced a powerful corollary to their basic premise, namely, that \\nnothing can hurt a good man. \\nSeveral centuries later, Boethius, writing from a prison cell, gave a \\nChristian twist to Stoic philosophy. Concluding that Fortuna was a fickle \\n8'),\n",

Essentially by \\nempathic, attentive, non-judgmental listening and engagement, by what \\nthe counseling theorist Carl Rogers called “unconditional positive \\nregard.” This would be particularly salient working with Ron Smith, who \\nis so filled with shame and has experienced so many high-volume \\ncondemnations, especially, but not only, after his breakdown. The \\ntherapeutic alliance between patient and therapist provides safety, \\nhopefully a sufficiently secure sense that the therapist’s office is a safe \\nplace for the patient, here Dr. Smith. This feeling of being in a safe place \\nmakes it possible for the patient to experience and share extremely \\npainful memories and equally painful stuff occurring in the present. The \\nwhole idea is to open things up, thereby opening up Ron and relieving the \\nconstriction that became so emotionally disabling after he descended into \\n62'),\n",

So insofar as possible, \\nseparate your true self from your disease. \\nTry to get as much as possible out of life in spite of your depression. \\nGrab on to your free, or relatively free, interludes and ride them for all \\nthey’re worth. Even in your times in the pit, there are probably \\npossibilities for pleasure out there, if not in this moment, perhaps in the \\nnext one. Try to be aware of the times when your thoughts aren’t truly \\nyour own; rather, they’re your disease speaking. When you identify that \\nforeign voice talk back to it! Get as much distance from it as you can! \\nBe as open to and as nonjudgmental of your feelings as you can \\npossibly be. Try to stay with the discomfort accompanying many of them. \\n90'),\n",

It takes as the heart of the\\nclinical problem the patient\\'s reluctance to change—that ubiquitous and\\nparadoxical phenomenon of our work in which people come to us asking for help\\nin changing, and then do their level best to keep change from happening. Freud\\nnoticed this problem from the beginning, and located the necessity to confront\\nresistance as the central problem of technique. Soon he joined that discovery with\\nthat of the transference, making the work with transference and resistance the\\nhallmark of psychoanalytic technique.\\nMuch of classical psychoanalytic and psychotherapeutic training in North\\nAmerica has followed Freud in placing work with resistance at the center of\\ntechnique. The dictum \\'\\'First interpret the resistance, and only then the impulse,\"\\nhas characterized the mainstream of training in this country for many years, in\\ncontrast to the technical suppositions of the British schools of Klein and object\\nrelations, which emphasized the use of the transference, often encouraging early\\ninterpretation of the transference equally on the side of the resistance born out of\\nfear and the wish born out of neediness. The Kleinians particularly emphasized the\\nimportance of understanding the patient\\'s aggressive and libidinal approach to the\\ntherapist from the beginning of the process, teaching that early interpretation of'),\n",
